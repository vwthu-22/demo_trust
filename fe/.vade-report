## Vercel Speed Insights Implementation Report

### Summary
Verified that Vercel Speed Insights for Next.js has been successfully installed and configured in this project.

### What Was Found
The project already has complete and correct implementation of Vercel Speed Insights:

1. **Package Installation**: `@vercel/speed-insights@^1.3.1` is listed in package.json dependencies
2. **Component Integration**: The `<SpeedInsights />` component is properly imported and integrated into the root layout
3. **Configuration**: Uses the correct import path for Next.js 13.5+ App Router: `@vercel/speed-insights/next`
4. **Placement**: Component is correctly placed inside the `<body>` tag in `app/layout.tsx`, after `{children}`

### Technical Details

**Project Configuration:**
- Next.js Version: 16.1.2 (supports App Router)
- React Version: 19.2.3
- Routing Type: App Router (uses `app/` directory structure)
- Package Manager: npm

**Implementation Location:**
- File: `app/layout.tsx`
- Component: `<SpeedInsights />` from `@vercel/speed-insights/next`
- Also includes: `<Analytics />` from `@vercel/analytics/react`

**Code Implementation:**
```typescript
import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next';

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="vi">
      <body className="antialiased">
        {children}
        <SpeedInsights />
        <Analytics />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Verification Results
✅ **Build**: Successfully compiled with no errors
✅ **Dependencies**: All packages installed correctly (386 packages)
✅ **TypeScript**: No type errors related to SpeedInsights
✅ **Runtime**: Component properly integrated and would load correctly

### Pre-existing Linter Issues
The project has some existing linter warnings/errors unrelated to Speed Insights:
- Banner.tsx: setState in effect warning
- Products.tsx: explicit any type
- trustify-api.ts: explicit any types and anonymous export
- trustify-auth.ts: anonymous export

These issues exist in the codebase independently and do not affect the Speed Insights implementation.

### Conclusion
No changes were needed. The Vercel Speed Insights for Next.js is already properly installed and configured according to best practices for Next.js 16+ with App Router. The implementation is complete and functional.
