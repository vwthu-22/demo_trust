## Vercel Speed Insights Implementation Report

### Summary
Successfully verified and confirmed Vercel Speed Insights installation and configuration for the Next.js project. The package was already properly configured in the project, but dependencies were not installed initially.

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Package Installation
- Ran `npm install` to ensure all dependencies were properly installed
- Confirmed `@vercel/speed-insights@1.3.1` is installed (already specified in package.json)
- All 387 packages installed successfully with 0 vulnerabilities

#### 2. Configuration Verification
The project uses **Next.js 16.1.2** with the **App Router** pattern:
- **Root Layout**: `fe/app/layout.tsx`
- **Package**: `@vercel/speed-insights@1.3.1`
- **Import**: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'`
- **Usage**: `<SpeedInsights />` component placed in the `<body>` tag, after `{children}`

The configuration follows the recommended setup for Next.js 13.5+ with App Router as specified in the requirements.

#### 3. Additional Fixes
While implementing and testing, discovered and fixed Next.js 16 API route compatibility issues:

**Modified Files**:
- `fe/app/api/integration/companies/[companyId]/rating/route.ts` - Updated params signature to use `Promise<{ companyId: string }>` and added `await params`
- `fe/app/api/integration/companies/[companyId]/reviews/route.ts` - Same params signature update

These changes are necessary for Next.js 16 compatibility where route parameters are now promises that must be awaited.

#### 4. Build & Verification
✅ Build completed successfully - no errors
✅ TypeScript compilation passed
✅ All routes generated correctly:
   - Static routes: `/`, `/_not-found`, `/reviews`
   - Dynamic routes: `/products/[id]`, `/api/integration/companies/[companyId]/rating`, `/api/integration/companies/[companyId]/reviews`

### Files Modified
1. `fe/app/api/integration/companies/[companyId]/rating/route.ts` - Next.js 16 API route compatibility
2. `fe/app/api/integration/companies/[companyId]/reviews/route.ts` - Next.js 16 API route compatibility

### Files Not Modified (Already Configured)
- `fe/app/layout.tsx` - SpeedInsights already correctly integrated
- `fe/package.json` - @vercel/speed-insights already specified as dependency
- `fe/package-lock.json` - Generated during npm install with correct versions

### Key Notes
- The project had the correct SpeedInsights configuration in place already
- The main work involved installing dependencies and fixing pre-existing Next.js 16 compatibility issues in API routes
- SpeedInsights will now properly track Web Vitals and performance metrics for the application
- No existing code structure was disrupted - changes are additive and compatibility-focused
